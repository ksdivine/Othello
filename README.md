# Othello
This repo is a simple reconstruction of the board game Othello. It is written in C++ using SDL for visuals.

You will need SDL and a C++ compiler (g++) to be able to create the project. 
(If using WSL you will also need Xming. Download Xming and type "export DISPLAY=:0")

To build the project git clone the project into a personal directory. Type "make" into the terminal and then type "./othello".
